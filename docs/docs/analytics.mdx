abstract: Rasa Pro Analytics is an ETL pipeline that extracts model, training, and conversation data from the Rasa platform and creates a queryable and extensible database schema.
---

You can query and
visualise metrics in a frontend tool of your choice (e.g. Metabase, PowerBI)

Measure the success of a Rasa assistant and making strategic investments
will lead to better business outcomes. It will also help you understand
the needs of your end users and better serve them.

Rasa Pro Analytics will start analyzing your conversations as soon as
the docker container is successfully deployed
and connected to your database and Kafka instances.

## Ingesting past Conversational data

- if you've previously already streamed the data of your assistant to Kafka
  and Kafka is configured to retain events on this topic, you can
  connect Analytics to your Kafka instance and it will process all prior
  events.
- if not, ingest the data using

  ```shell
  rasa export --endpoints endpoints.yml
  ```

  The export needs to be configured to read from your production tracker store
  and write to Kafka as an event broker, e.g.

  ```yaml-rasa title="endpoints.yml"
    tracker_store:
        type: SQL
        dialect: "postgresql"
        url: "localhost"
        db: "tracker"
        username: postgres
        password: password

    event_broker:
        type: kafka
        topic: rasa-events
        url: localhost:29092
        partition_by_sender: true # VERY IMPORTANT!!!!

  ```
