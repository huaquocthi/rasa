You can query and
visualise metrics in a frontend tool of your choice (e.g. Metabase, PowerBI)

Measure the success of a Rasa assistant and making strategic investments
will lead to better business outcomes. It will also help you understand
the needs of your end users and better serve them.

Rasa Pro Analytics will start analyzing your conversations as soon as
the docker container is successfully deployed
and connected to your database and Kafka instances.

## Getting Started

### Ingesting past Conversational data

- if you've previously already streamed the data of your assistant to Kafka
  and Kafka is configured to retain events on this topic, you can
  connect Analytics to your Kafka instance and it will process all prior
  events.
- if not, ingest the data using

  ```shell
  rasa export --endpoints endpoints.yml
  ```

  The export needs to be configured to read from your production tracker store
  and write to Kafka as an event broker, e.g.

  ```yaml-rasa title="endpoints.yml"
    tracker_store:
        type: SQL
        dialect: "postgresql"
        url: "localhost"
        db: "tracker"
        username: postgres
        password: password

    event_broker:
        type: kafka
        topic: rasa-events
        url: localhost:29092
        partition_by_sender: true # VERY IMPORTANT!!!!

  ```

## Example Queries

Inspiration on how to analyze the conversations your assistant is having. The
example queries are created using Metabase.

### Daily Chatbot Users

#### Query using SQL

```sql
SELECT CAST("public"."rasa_users"."FIRST_SEEN" AS date) AS "FIRST_SEEN", count(*) AS "count"
FROM "public"."rasa_users"
GROUP BY CAST("public"."rasa_users"."FIRST_SEEN" AS date)
ORDER BY CAST("public"."rasa_users"."FIRST_SEEN" AS date) ASC
```

#### Using the Metabase Query Builder

<div align="center">
  <img
    alt="Example query for a query showcasing the number of users per day."
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/analytics/number-of-users-query.png")}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

#### Result

<div align="center">
  <img
    alt="Example result for a query showcasing the number of users per day."
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/analytics/number-of-users-result.png")}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

</div>

### Table `rasa_actions`

The `rasa_actions` table contains information about all actions that got
executed by the assistant across all conversations.

| Column | Type        | Description                                   |
| :----- | :---------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| id     | varchar 255 | Unique ID of this event. Same as the event_id |
| ...    | ...         | ...                                           |
